Bad Bugs is a Frogger-like arcade game.
## How to play
The main goal of this game is to reach the topmost row on the level. Your enemies are bugs. If you hit them, you loose your life. When you're on the top row, you get some points. To make it more fun enemies change its speed every time a player reaches the topmost row. Also there's a collectable star, which gives you additional points. Score as many points as you can!
